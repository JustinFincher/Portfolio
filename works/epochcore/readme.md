# About  
> Lonely Planet (now called "Epoch Core" due to trademark issues), is a tech demo for my procedural space shooter project ("Epoch").  
In order to achieve fast planet generation, I ported a subset of C++ based libNoise into the cg shader language. As noise data is then generated in parallel (by shader), the total generation time of a 2048x1024 sized height-map was shortened from 8-15 seconds to around 120 ms (Tested on iPhone 6S). That's blazing fast.
