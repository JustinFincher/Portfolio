# About
> Echo Chamber is a compilation of posts made on my blog, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms, as an attempt at self-publishing as well as a yearly project.

# Design
> The book was designed in Sketch. Each page contains a set of guidelines (Safe area, Trim, Bleed, etc) to match with the specification (6x9 inches, 15x23 cm, Hardcover).
> Images and texts were then added to the page and positioned to match with the guidelines.

# Web Reader
